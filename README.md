## Introduction

Welcome to the Drone Delivery System project! This C++ program calculates the time and cost of delivering parcels using drones, considering various factors like parcel type, weight, state of matter, weather, and delivery location. The program also offers a selection of drones from an inventory.

## Features

- **Smart Drone Selection:** The system intelligently chooses the most suitable drone based on parcel characteristics and weather conditions.
- **Real-time Estimates:** Get accurate estimates of delivery time and cost in real-time.
- **Inventory Management:** Manage and update the inventory of available drones with ease.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The command-line interface is designed for a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- C++ Compiler
- Any necessary dependencies (mention them if required)
